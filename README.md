## General info
Runedal is a practice and hobby project I made to hone my C# skills. 
It's a single player, fantasy RPG game, where most of the action
is displayed in a form of plain, often colored text. You control your
character by typing predefined commands, allowing you to 
explore the world, slay enemies, gather items, talk
and trade with NPCs and develop your character in an unique way.

## Technologies
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
.NET 6.0
C# 10

## Features
- Large world to explore, with two different towns, many locations, enemies
and bosses, providing at least 3-6 hours of gameplay
- Real-time gameplay system
- Triggerable hints, allowing player to learn the game through playing
- Minimalistic GUI, including health/mana bars, action bar and minimap
- Balanced stats and attributes system allowing for an unique character development
- Save/load system
- An option to pause the game and speed up/slow down the game clock
- Command history (up to 10 last typed commands)
- Entire game content in a form of easily editable JSON files

## Flaws/Issues
- poor game content - no lore, no quests, just exploring and slaying enemies.
- only one language option (polish)
- the game won't launch when installed in 'program files' directory
